## 2014/08/04 - MI - DEGASSING BY SONICATION

Samples 14, 15, 16 and 17 were degassed in the water bath sonicator:
- I covered the vial lables (and also around the caps) with parafilm to keep the labels dry.
- 10 minute sonication ('Degassing' option of the instrument) 
- Water bath temperature was set to 30'C at start and became 36'C at the end of 10 min sonication

* Sonicator water bath heats up extremely slowly, it took ~ 1 hour to raise the temperature to 30'C from room temperature.
